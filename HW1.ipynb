    "Write a function to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem through simulation. The function takes two arguments #ndoors and #ntrials, representing the number of doors in the experiment and the number of trails in a simulation, respectively. The function should return the proportion of wins for both the switch and no-switch strategy. Apply your function with 3 doors and 5 doors, both with 1000 trials. Include sufficient text around the code to explain your them.\n",
